# Welcome!

Hello and welcome to the official Project: SMP server guide! You will get to know everything on the server here!

## What is Project: SMP?

Project: SMP was started in June 2020, then known as AppleCraft, by FokaStudio as a small Minecraft SMP \(Survival Multiplayer\) to casually play with other people.   
The first project was made terribly and was a total failure due to the bad host and lack of moderation knowledge.   
Foka decided to countinue the project, after the change of host on July he started making the server once again \(which ended making it again at least 4 times, as other were malfunctioning\).The server's name evolved few times, starting from AppleCraft. Then known as AppleRealms \(but never released\), CraftIdeal for 3 months \(this one got released!\) and finally known with today's name - Project: SMP.   
Two more people joined the project since the moment it was a scratch - GeneralDuckyJR and aimwar, who both are now Admins.   
The project has expanded and now it is a perfectly composed SMP, with almost all aspects of the game highly expanded, starting from simple things, like fixing some bugs, adding simple features through Magic and more mobs ending at stuff related to world generation and improving Minecraft's structures.  
 Server is actively developed with new things being added every day!
