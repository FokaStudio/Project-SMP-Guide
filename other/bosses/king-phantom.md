# King Phantom

**King Phantom** is a rare version of a regular **Phantom**, but it's way bigger, tougher and stronger. **A King of all Phantoms**.

## **Appearance**

Well, what can I say, it's just a **giant Phantom** that flies over the sky and **kills anyone on his way**.

**King Phantom** always comes with additional protection in form of **5 Royal Guards**.

## Spawning

**King Phantom** has a small chance \(**0.005%**\) of spawning in the place of normal **Phantom**, which means that he can spawn in any dimension - **naturally** in the **Overworld**, in **Withering Forest** in the **Nether** and from **Endermen** in **all dimensions**.

Upon spawn all players will hear a **Phantom scream** and slowed down **Wither** spawn sound. Then it's just all about locating the **King**. And then defeating him. Good luck...

## Drops

If someone somehow manages to defeat Phantom King, the drops are really rewarding.

* 0 - \(22 + Looting x 7\) of **Phantom Membrane**
* **King Phantom's Wings** \(Mythical Elytra, more info in [Other Items](../../items/other-items.md)\)

## Royal Guard \(Phantom King\)

## Info

**Royal Guards** are much smaller than their **King**, but still pretty **deadly**. They will **protect** their **King**, no matter what it takes.

They **always** spawn in group of **5** next to their **King**.

Upon death, they drop regular **Phantom loot**, so their only purpose is to **protect their Lord**
